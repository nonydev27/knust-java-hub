## 👋 About This Repo
**What's good, guys!** I created this repository specifically for us **Computer Science students at KNUST**. We are all studying Java right now, and things can get tricky. 

This repo serves as a central hub where I upload:
* ✅ **Class Assignments** (Solved)
* 📚 **Past Questions** (with Logic explained)
* 🛠️ **Useful Utilities** (Calculators, Grading Systems, etc.)

Feel free to clone this, study the code, and use it to understand the logic behind the assignments.
