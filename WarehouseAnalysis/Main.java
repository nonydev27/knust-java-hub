        /*A logistics company needs a tool to analyze the weight distribution of boxes in a warehouse shipment. You are required to write a Java program named WarehouseAnalysis that processes a fixed set of inventory data.

1. Data Initialization:
* Create an array of doubles containing the following 10 box weights: 12.5, 55.0, 45.0, 18.0, 22.5, 60.0, 30.0, 15.0, 50.0, 10.0. 

2. Classification Logic:
Iterate through the array and classify each box based on the following criteria:
* Heavy: Weight > 50 kg
* Medium: Weight between 20 kg and 50 kg (inclusive)
* Light: Weight < 20 kg
* For each box, print its index (starting from 1) and its classification.

3. Statistical Calculations:
* Calculate the Total Weight of all boxes.
* Calculate the Average Weight of the shipment.
* Count how many boxes fall into each category (Heavy, Medium, Light).
* Identify the Heaviest Box, noting both its weight and its position in the sequence.

4. Output Requirements:
* Display the classification list first.
* Display a summary section showing the total weight, average weight, counts for each category, and the details of the heaviest box found. */
