    /*
A local utility company requires a Java program to help residents estimate their electricity bills based on individual appliance usage. 
You are tasked with developing the ElectricityBillCalculator class.

1. Constants & Inputs:
* Define a constant COST_PER_KWH with a value of 0.20.
* Prompt the user to input the total number of appliances (n).
* Use a for loop to collect the consumption (kWh) for each of the n appliances.

2. Conditional Logic (The Surcharge):
* Calculate the base cost for each appliance.
* If an appliance's consumption exceeds 100 kWh, apply a 15% surcharge to its calculated cost.

3. Data Accumulation & Output:
* For every appliance, print a detailed line showing the appliance number, the kWh used, and the final cost (clearly flagging if a surcharge was applied).
* Maintain a running total for both Total Consumption and Total Cost.
* Display the final totals after the loop finishes, formatted to 2 decimal places. */
