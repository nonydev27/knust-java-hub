    /*QUESTION 4
Telecel, a well known mobile service provider needs a script to monitor a user's data consumption in real-time. You are required to write a Java program named MobileDataMonitor that simulates a declining data balance.

1. Initial State:
* Start the user with an initial balance of 20.0 GB.
* Initialize a variable to track the total data used across all sessions.

2. The Monitoring Loop:
* Use a while loop that continues to run as long as the data balance is greater than zero.
* Inside the loop, prompt the user to enter the amount of data used in the current session.

3. Input Validation & Processing:
* If the user enters a negative value, display an error message and skip the rest of the loop logic (using the continue keyword) to ask for input again.
* Subtract the valid usage from the current balance and add it to the total usage.

4. Status Alerts:
Implement the following notification system based on the remaining balance:
* Balance > 5 GB: "Data balance is sufficient."
* Balance between 1 GB and 5 GB: "Warning: Data balance is low."
* Balance between 0 GB and 1 GB: "Critical: Data almost exhausted."
* Balance  <= 0 GB: "Data exhausted. Internet disconnected."

5. Final Summary:
* Once the loop terminates, display the total data used and the final balance (formatted to 2 decimal places). */
