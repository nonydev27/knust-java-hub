    *QUESTION 1*
A science lab is running a series of heat experiments. You need to write a program that calculates the average temperature of each experiment and flags any that are "Unstable."

1. *Constants & Setup:*
• Prompt the user for the number of experiments being conducted.
• For each experiment, the user will provide two temperature readings (Morning and Evening).

2. *The Loop:*
• Use a for loop to iterate through the total number of experiments.

3. *The Logic:*
• Inside the loop, prompt for the morningTemp and the eveningTemp.
• Calculate the Average Temperature for that specific experiment.
• If the average temperature is greater than 100°C, print: "Experiment [i]: [Average]°C - STATUS: UNSTABLE".
• Otherwise, print: "Experiment [i]: [Average]°C - STATUS: NORMAL".

4. *Data Accumulation:*
• Maintain a running total of the averages to calculate the Final Grand Average for the whole lab session after the loop finishes. */
