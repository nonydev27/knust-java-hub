        /*A local cinema requires a kiosk application to handle ticket sales. You are tasked with writing a Java program named CinemaTicketBooking that allows users to select multiple ticket types and provides a final summary.

1. Looping Structure:
* Use a do-while loop to display a menu of options to the user repeatedly.
* The menu must continue to appear until the user selects the "Finish Booking" option (Option 4).

2. Pricing & Selection:
Implement the following ticket categories:
* Option 1 (Regular): ₵25.00
* Option 2 (Student): ₵15.00
* Option 3 (VIP): ₵50.00
* Any input other than 1, 2, 3, or 4 should trigger an "Invalid option" message.

3. Data Tracking:
* Maintain a running count of the total number of tickets booked.
* Accumulate the total cost of all selected tickets.

4. Categorization & Summary:
After the user finishes booking (exits the loop), display a summary based on the following logic:
* If no tickets were purchased, display "No tickets booked."
* If between 1 and 3 tickets were purchased, classify it as a "Standard booking."
* If more than 3 tickets were purchased, classify it as a "Group booking."

5. Output Formatting:
* Print the total ticket count and the total cost (formatted to 2 decimal places). */
