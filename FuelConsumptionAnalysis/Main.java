package FuelConsumptionAnalysis;

public class Main {
    /*A logistics company tracks the daily fuel consumption of a single vehicle over a one-week period. You are required to write a Java program named FuelConsumptionAnalysis to process this data.

1. Data Setup:
* Initialize an array of doubles named fuelConsumption with the following values: {12.5, 22.0, 8.4, 18.6, 25.3, 9.8, 15.0}.

2. Iterative Requirements (Strict Restriction):
* You must use a while loop to traverse the array.
* Ensure you manually manage the index pointer to avoid an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

3. Classification Logic:
For each day, categorize the fuel usage based on these thresholds:
* High: > 20 liters
* Normal: 10 to 20 liters (inclusive)
* Low: < 10 liters

4. Calculations & Aggregations:
* Calculate the Total and Average fuel consumption for the week.
* Maintain a count for each category (High, Normal, Low).
* Find the peak consumption day (both the day number and the amount).

5. Output Formatting:
* Print a line-by-line report for each day.
* Use printf to ensure all fuel values and averages are displayed to 2 decimal places. */
