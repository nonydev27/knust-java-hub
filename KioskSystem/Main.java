    /**QUESTION 6*
Develop a Java program named *KioskSystem* that simulates a fast-food ordering terminal. The program must allow for multiple items to be added to a cart before final checkout.

1. *Iterative Logic:*
• Implement a do-while loop to keep the terminal active until the user chooses to "Checkout" (Option 3).

2. *Item Pricing & Inventory:*
• Burger: $5.99
• Fries: $2.50
• The program should prompt the user for a quantity whenever an item is selected.

3. *Validation:*
• Use decision statements to handle the menu choices.
• Inside the Burger and Fries cases, ensure the user cannot enter a negative quantity. If they do, display an error and do not add to the total.

4. *Data Accumulation:*
• Track the Grand Total cost of all items.
• Track the Total Item Count (e.g., 2 burgers + 1 fries = 3 items).

5. *Output Requirements:*
• Provide feedback after every successful addition (e.g., "Added 2 Burgers to cart").
• Upon checkout, display the total number of items purchased and the final bill amount formatted to 2 decimal places. */
